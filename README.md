# Python-CSV-Personal-Use
Using the csv module in python to make life easier.


### Why I wrote this code
I had to sort [this](https://github.com/diptangsu/Python-CSV-Personal-Use/blob/master/input/Python%20Skill%20Development%20Programme%20Registration%20FINAL.csv) file into each department per year.  
Writing this piece of code was fun and I also got the job done!
